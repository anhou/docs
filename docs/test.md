Colons can be used to align columns.

|----------|----------|
| foo      | bar      |
| baz      | qux      |
| quux     | quuz     |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
