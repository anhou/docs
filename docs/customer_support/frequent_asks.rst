  Q: How can I set obms automatically when node discovered in HP server?

  A: There is a "autoCreateObm" property you can set to true in your config.json file. 
     When the autoCreateObm and arpCacheEnabled in opt/monorail/config.json are set to true, Discovery workflow will 
     create a random credential using ipmitool in the container inside RancherOS and get the MAC Address from catalog, 
     and use arp to lookup the IP of the specific server.
